# helical-magnetic-cavity
equilibrium model of helical magnetic cavity

The demo.m consist of two files, the code_submit and the momentum_submit.
The code_submit is used to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in the cylindrical coordinates, with an output file named as data.mat.
The momentum_submit calculates the momentums based on the distribution functions. This file also includes the figure part, denoting to understanding the outputs.
